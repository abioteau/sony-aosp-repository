Subject: [PATCH] Fix bug Device that can't support adoptable storage cannot
 read the sdcard.

Only Primary storag and adoptable storage can get visible flag.
so, Unless Device support adoptable stoarge, it cannot have visible path for
sdcard.
In refrernce, Adoptable storage cannot support FBE.

If device cannot get visible path for sdcard, 3rd app and MTP cannot
read sdcard even though they have READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.

this fixing is releasing visible condition for all sdcard.

Test: Check MountFlags is VISIBLE on Log.
